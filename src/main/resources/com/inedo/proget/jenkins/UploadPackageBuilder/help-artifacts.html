<div>
	You can use wildcards like 'module/dist/**/*.zip'. See [the includes attribute of Ant fileset](http://ant.apache.org/manual/Types/fileset.html) for the exact format.
	<ul>
		<li>Multiple patterns can be specified by placing a comma (,) between them</li>
		<li>The base directory is the workspace. You can only archive files that are located in your workspace</li>
		<li>Will fail the build if no files are found</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>
	<b>Removing Unwanted Folders</b><br />
	Top level folders can be excluded from the package using a custom addition to the Ant fileset - wrapping unwanted folder names in square brackets ([ ]):
	
	<ul>
		<li>filter must start with '['</li>
		<li>wildcards are not supported</li>
		<li>filter can span a several folders</li>
		<li>invalid filters are ignored</li>
		<li>can be used with multiple filesets</li>
	</ul>
	
	Examples:
	<ul>
		<li>"<i>[build]/sample/one.txt</i>" would add the folder and file "sample/one.txt" to the package</li>
		<li>"<i>[build/sample]/two.txt</i>" would add the file "one.txt" to the package</li>
		<li>"<i>build/[sample]/three.txt</i>" would be ignored</li> 
		<li>"<i>[**]/four.txt</i>" would be ignored</li>
		<li>"<i>[one]/one.txt, [two]/two.txt</i>" would add one.txt and two.txt to the package</li>
	</ul>
	</p>
</div>
