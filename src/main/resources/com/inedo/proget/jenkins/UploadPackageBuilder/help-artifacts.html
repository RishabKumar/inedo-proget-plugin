<div>
	You can use wildcards like 'module/dist/**/*.zip'. See [the includes attribute of Ant fileset](http://ant.apache.org/manual/Types/fileset.html) for the exact format.
	Multiple patterns can be specified by placing a comma (,) them.
	The base directory is the workspace. You can only archive files that are located in your workspace.
	
	Will fail the build if no files are found.
	
	
	<p><b>TODO</b> Should support setting base directory so that if archiving 'workspace/build/blah/somefile' then
	the folder 'workspace/build/blah' won't be included in the package.  Also should have advanced setting for case 
	sensitivity and maybe use default excludes</p>
